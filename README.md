Most layouts' grids come from 960 grid system

##### Don't design based on available tools

Float is like a bunch of bars of soap in a bathtub, all of them trying to bubble up to the top

CSS Initial letter, like the big beginning letter for a paragraph

feature query: @support conditional in your css directly

height vh: viewport height
- vmin
- vmax

Object Fit: crops image when space is filled
- cover

Shape Outside property

Mondrian came up after lots of victorian embellishments and symmetry. Was about uncentered clean structure.

## Motion Paths Beyond SVG
@dancwilson
https://danielcwilson.com/talks/2016/motionpath

SVG using simple lines, paths, keyframes, and transforms

### CSS Motion Paths
- takes stuff from SVG and uses the DOM via css and JS
- motion-path, motion-offset, motion-rotation properties
    + just renamed those properites: offset-path, offset-distance, offset-rotation

## Applicable ES6
@wesbos

#### `let` and `const`
- block scoped
    + only available inside the block they're defined in
- const can't really be changed, but is not immutable!
    + prevents wiping or re-binding of variable

#### Template strings
- will start using backticks!
    + allow for real string interpolation
    + can do multiline strings automaticallys

#### If statements
- uses ternerary statements

#### Render functions
- can define functions seperately for returning html in string form

#### Default Function Args
- definable in the function definition (like ruby)

#### Arrow Functions
- use arrow instead of `function`
- can lose parens if only one argument
- implicit return
    + one liner with no `{}`

#### Enhanced Object Literals
- create objects from variables, listing the variables once instead of the property name and then the same variable name

#### Tooling
- Transpiling
    + Babel ES6 -> ES5 to let it run
- Polyfill
    + babel again

#### Destructuring
- create/assign vars in single line of code
    + `const {first, twitter, city} = person`
        * `person` being an object
- can rename while destructuring
- default variables in destructure statement
- works with arrays, too
- swap values

#### Sets
- a unique array with solid API for manipulation
- only can contain unique data
- `.has('this')`
- `for(const student of students) {}`

## How to Fight and Prevent Burnout
https://speakerdeck.com/aliciasedlock/how-to-fights-and-prevent-burnout

#### Expectations of Technical Growth
- expectations of personal growth, side projects
- assumptions of people's time and feedback

#### Realities of technical growth
- outside of work hours is unpaid labor
- ageism in tech

##### Why more public stories of burnout

#### Hypothesis A
- push for representation
- minority groups are already working hard just to keep par

#### Hypothesis B
- devs expected to know everything right away

#### Hypothesis C
- ageism puts pressure on junior and senior devs

#### Hypothesis D
- info overload makes us feel behind

#### Stages of burnout
- compulsion to prove yourself
- working harder
    + proving themselves internal/externall
- neglecting their own needs
- displacement of conflicts
- revision of values
- denial of emerging problems
    + bleeding into personal life
- withdrawal/isolation
- obvious behavioral changes
- depersonalization (not seeing self as valuable)
- inner emptiness
- depression
- burnout syndrome
    + physical/emotional collapse, may require medical attention at this stage

#### Burnout vs brownout
- latter doesn't have collapse, but may be an omen of the former
- burnout/brownout treated as a badge

## What to do about it?
- It's as much about the person as it is about the organization

#### As Individuals
- Say no
- check in on yourself actively
- learn in moderation
- focus on extensible knowledge
- what do you want people to know you for?
- passive learning

#### As Leaders
- take no as an answer
- don't assume people will speak up
- make sure your employees are set up for success
- 1-on-1 meetings
- want them to learn, so give them the time to do it
- understand boundaries

###### We all have intellectual FOMO.

###### If it's not your bottom line, don't do it.

## Keynote: The Seasonal Web Designer
- Reign: iPhone game about balance

- cycle of web development and balancing how quickly things move

#### Philosophical
- purpose behind what we're doing

#### Adventurous
- translating beliefs into action

#### Constructive
- do job effectively and efficiently

#### Restorative
- can I give myself time to heal and recover regularly?
- not naturally encouraged by the web
